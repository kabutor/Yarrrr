Card videogame about pirates, you can install on your Android device or download the exe, it's done in unity.

Game support one player and multiplayer LAN only, you can mix and match devices (Android vs PC for example) as long as you are in the same local network. One player must Host the game, the other can join.

Game is based on my prototype on the BGG:
